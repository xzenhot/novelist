# Book Instance: The Invisible Law - A Prophet of Science and Soul

This is a **book-specific instance** of the dynamic writer agent. The complete writing engine, voice guidelines, structural formula, and execution instructions live in [`../book.md`](../book.md). Read that file first — it defines how to write.

This file only supplies the **subject-specific inputs** for this particular book.

## Inputs

1. **Seed file**: `../context/qualities/aurilus.md`
   - Analysis of Marcus Aurelius's *Meditations* (translated by Jeremy Collier, revised by Alice Zimmern, 1887)
   - Defines the Stoic philosophical framework, metaphor families, and quality metrics

2. **Index file**: `bookseed.txt`
   - List of topics/terms in the target language, one per line (e.g. `Acceleration (Acceleration)`, `Force (Force)`)
   - Each term becomes one chapter

3. **Reference book**: `../context/references/aurilus.txt`
   - The source text of *The Meditations* for stylistic grounding

## Subject-Specific Configuration

### Language
- **Target language** — use the archaic/literary register (formal or archaic equivalents appropriate to the target language)

### Book Title
- **The Invisible Law: A Prophet of Science and Soul** (The Invisible Law: A Prophet of Science and Soul)

### Context
It is 2026, a world fractured by dissent and digital noise. You deliver sermons in the style of Almustafa's departure from Orphalese, but your philosophical foundation is the *Meditations* of Marcus Aurelius — the emperor who wrote to himself alone, wrestling with virtue, transience, and the unity of all things. You transform the cold language of physics into the warm language of the soul.

### Sacred Vocabulary (subject-specific, in Bengali)
- The guiding principle (The Ruler Within / discerning reason)
- The inner citadel (The Inner Citadel)
- The commonwealth of all (one great body / The One Blood)
- The logos / divine reason (Silent Law / great reason)
- Amor fati — love of fate (The Beloved Necessity)
- Transience (passing / changing)

### The Ten Thematic Categories (from Marcus Aurelius)
Assign each term to one of these Stoic categories, cycling through them:

1. **The Inner Citadel** (The Inner Citadel) — withdrawal into self as refuge
2. **The One Blood** (The One Blood) — universal kinship, all as one body
3. **The Fading Name** (The Fading Name) — indifference to fame
4. **The Only Present** (The Only Present) — the eternal now
5. **The Beloved Necessity** (The Beloved Necessity) — amor fati, acceptance of fate
6. **The Last Change** (The Last Change) — death as transformation
7. **The Royal Service** (The Royal Service) — service as nobility
8. **The Uncluttered Soul** (The Uncluttered Soul) — simplicity and detachment
9. **The Woven Whole** (The Woven Whole) — the unity of all things
10. **The Undefeated Virtue** (The Undefeated Virtue) — virtue's invincibility

## How to Invoke

> "Writer, use the dynamic agent at `book.md` with these inputs:
> - **Seed file**: `../context/qualities/aurilus.md`
> - **Index file**: `bookseed.txt`
> - **Reference book**: `../context/references/aurilus.txt`
>
> Write [N] chapters on the next [N] topics from the index."

The dynamic agent will read `book.md` for the writing engine, then apply the subject-specific configuration above to generate chapters grounded in Marcus Aurelius's Stoic wisdom, rendered in Gibran's prophetic Bengali voice.
