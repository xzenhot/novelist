description: Write or rewrite a novel chapter as flat, continuous prose (no section headings). Driven by the chapter's model.json, honoring the assigned signature and theme. Applies an optional transformer style and any human override instructions as the final layer. Saves rewrites inside the chapter's segment writer folder.

# Novel Write — Flat Prose

Use this skill for a novel pipeline to write (or rewrite) one chapter's core content so it becomes deeper, more finished, and more human — optionally in a named transformer style.

## The Flatten Rule (ESTABLISHED)

The chapter output is **always flat, continuous prose** — never sectioned. The `## Workshop`, `## Story`, and `## Discussion` headings are **removed entirely**; only the prose that followed them remains, merged into continuous paragraphs. Do not leave empty headings, stray `#` markers, or orphaned labels. The only heading permitted is the chapter title (`# {chapter_title}`) if the pipeline convention requires a title. This rule is absolute and overrides any other instruction in this skill.

## Scope

This skill works on **one chapter at a time** in an existing pipeline, driven by the chapter's metadata:

- Chapter guidance (authoritative, carries every prior filter's result): `.space/pipeline/<bookname>/chapters/<n>/model.json` — the authoritative chapter metadata (topic/title, `chapter_summary`, `category`, `subject`, `era`, `place`, `figures`, `events`, `theme`, `theme_essence`, `metaphor_family`, `contemporary_mapping`, `stereotype` including `signature`/`reference`/`syntax_sample`/`theme_set`, and `word_target`). This is the sole per-chapter input; `chapter.md` is not read as a source.
- Optional mood: `.space/pipeline/<bookname>/chapters/<n>/mood.json`
- Human override instructions (always present; seeded at scaffold): `.space/pipeline/<bookname>/filters/override/filter.md`
- Output: `.space/pipeline/<bookname>/chapters/<n>/segments/1/writer/chapter_v<n>.md`

`<n>` is the chapter identifier: `Introduction`, `1`, `2`, ... `N`, `Conclusion`.

## What to Read

Before writing, read these files in order:

1. `.space/pipeline/<bookname>/chapters/<n>/model.json` — the chapter model (the only per-chapter input; never `chapter.md`).
2. `.space/pipeline/<bookname>/chapters/<n>/mood.json` — the chapter mood.
3. `.space/pipeline/<bookname>/characters.json` — the full character roster, if it exists.
4. `.space/pipeline/<bookname>/book.json` — the book identity and summary, if you need broader context.
5. `.space/pipeline/<bookname>/filters/override/filter.md` — the pipeline override command file (always present; created at scaffold). Read its `## Instructions` section for **every** rewrite and apply non-empty instructions to the new version (see *The Override Layer*).
6. (When `<style>` is provided) `.framework/templates/styles/<style>/style.md` — the transformer style template. If the style folder contains `signature.md`, read it as the interpretive authority for resolving ambiguity in `style.md` (see *The Style Layer*).

## Chapter Layout Contract

- `chapters/<n>/chapter.md` is the live working draft, authored only by the write/chapter/poet path — this skill never reads it as a source.
- `chapters/<n>/model.json` remains the authoritative runtime metadata file.
- Rewritten variants belong in `chapters/<n>/segments/1/writer/`, not in the chapter root.
- Before overwriting a writer-stage copy, archive the prior file into `chapters/<n>/history/`.
- `segments/1/editor/` is for editorial notes only, and `segments/1/translator/` is for translated derivatives only.

## How to Determine the Next Version Number

Look in the chapter's segment writer folder for any existing `chapter_v*.md` files:

- If none exist, the output is `chapter_v1.md`.
- If `chapter_v1.md`, `chapter_v2.md`, ... `chapter_vk.md` exist, the output is `chapter_v{k+1}.md`.
- Never overwrite an existing version; always increment.

## Rewriting Rules

1. **Flatten.** Remove the **Workshop** and **Discussion** frame headings entirely; merge their prose with the **Story** into continuous paragraphs. The output is flat prose, not a three-section frame.
2. **Honor the model.** Follow the chapter's `chapter_summary`, `included_characters`, `quality_parameters`, `theme`, `theme_essence`, and `era`/`place`.
3. **Deepen, don't invent.** Stay within the events and emotional arc already present in the source chapter. Do not add new major plot points or characters that are not already suggested by the chapter model.
4. **Lyrical prose.** Use long, flowing sentences; precise sensory detail; embodied metaphor; and rhythmic closure. Elevate the register without becoming ornate or artificial.
5. **Character interiority.** Reveal what the central figure does not say aloud: doubt, memory, longing, fatigue, resolve, tenderness, and the quiet choice to love again.
6. **Civilizational weight.** Treat domestic acts — tea, food, listening, welcome, repair — as civilizational labor, not small chores.
7. **Length.** Expand toward the novel's target word count (5,500+ words by default) by deepening scenes, adding dialogue, extending inner thought, and enriching setting and gesture. Do not pad with filler.
8. **Thread the theme.** Weave the chapter's assigned theme and its essence into the story's images and turning points.
9. **Hand the reader forward.** End with a resonant image or unresolved pull that leads naturally to the next chapter.

## The Style Layer (`<style>`)

When the caller provides a `<style>` argument, it selects a **transformer style** that reshapes the written content:

1. **Resolution.** Look for `.framework/templates/styles/<style>/style.md`. If the folder or `style.md` does not exist, stop and report, listing the available folders under `.framework/templates/styles/` — never silently write without the requested style.
2. **Authority.** If the style folder contains `signature.md`, read it and treat it as the interpretive authority for resolving ambiguity or tension within `style.md` (voice, identity, and tonal decisions).
3. **Application.** Apply the style to the rewritten prose. The style governs voice, imagery, and register — it never changes the chapter's metadata-driven content requirements (topic, theme, figures, word target) and never re-introduces section headings.
4. **Layer order.** Transformation layers apply in this order: chapter metadata (base) → style (voice/register) → override instructions (`filters/override/filter.md`, final and binding).
5. **No style provided.** If `<style>` is omitted, write normally from the chapter metadata and the book's configured stereotype/signature — no transformer style applies.

## The Override Layer (`filters/override/filter.md`)

`.space/pipeline/<bookname>/filters/override/filter.md` is the **pipeline override command file** — a human-authored instruction file created by the scaffold step. It must **always be present** in the pipeline. Apply it to **every** rewrite:

- If the file is somehow missing, recreate its baseline from `.framework/agents/override/agent.md` (form-customized, empty `## Instructions`) before rewriting; if you cannot, rewrite without override and report the missing file.
- If the `## Instructions` section (below the `---` line) is empty, rewrite the chapter normally — no override applies.
- If it holds instructions (bullets or paragraphs), treat **each one as binding** and apply it as the final layer to the new writer-stage file in `segments/1/writer/`.
- The human's word is final: apply instructions exactly; do not reinterpret, soften, or skip them.

## Language

Read the `language` field from the pipeline (`book.json` or `model.json`). Use that language for the rewritten content. If the language is `en`, use English. If it is another language code, write in that language. Do not assume a default language.

## Output Format

Write the rewritten chapter to the new writer-stage version file as **flat, continuous prose** — no section headings. The only heading permitted is the chapter title (`# {chapter_title}`) if the pipeline convention requires a title. Do not add `## Workshop`, `## Story`, `## Discussion`, or any other section labels.

Do not add extra metadata, comments, or explanation outside the chapter text.

## What Not to Do

- Do not scaffold pipelines.
- Do not run filters.
- Do not consult the backlog `.space/backlog/epic/<bookname>/override.md`; apply only the pipeline override command file `.space/pipeline/<bookname>/filters/override/filter.md`.
- Do not write version files in the chapter root; this skill produces writer-stage versions inside `segments/1/writer/` only.
- Do not write to `source/books/` — this skill produces chapter versions inside the pipeline only.
- Do not update `progress.json` — progress tracking is the writer workflow's responsibility.
- Do not merge versions or decide which version is final.
- Do not re-introduce section headings — the flatten rule is absolute.
